# Comparison UK and MA Road Accident Analysis Project


## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of the UK and MA Road Accident dataset using Python, SQL, and Tableau. The dataset, provided by the UK government's Open Data website, contains information on traffic accidents including geographic locations, weather conditions, vehicle types, and the number of casualties involved. Additionally, for the analysis of road accidents in Morocco, data will be leveraged from the latest report by Narsa. This comprehensive dataset will enable a detailed examination of road accident patterns, contributing factors, and geographical distribution, facilitating evidence-based decision-making for road safety initiatives in both the UK and Morocco.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors contributing to road accidents in the UK and Morocco and to identify areas where interventions may be necessary to improve road safety. Leveraging comprehensive datasets from both countries, the analysis aims to examine accident patterns, identify contributing factors, and assess the effectiveness of current road safety measures. The analysis follows the 6 phases of the Data Analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Act (APPAA), ensuring a systematic approach to understanding and addressing road safety challenges in both the UK and Morocco.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Used for data cleaning and preparation using the Pandas library.
- SQL: Utilized for data analysis and querying the dataset.
- Tableau: Used for data visualization and creating dynamic dashboards.
